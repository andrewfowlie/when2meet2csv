# When2Meet Data Export
When2Meet is a popular online scheduling tool that allows users to create event polls and gather availability information from participants. As someone responsible for scheduling manpower for a project, I encountered a challenge when using When2Meet. While it provided a convenient way to manage availability, the process of visualizing the data proved to be cumbersome and time-consuming.

When planning the manpower, it was crucial to consider factors such as member availability and workload distribution. Although When2Meet displayed the availability information, it required hovering over each cell individually to view the details. This manual process became mentally exhausting and hindered the efficiency of the scheduling process. It led me to wonder: Why doesn't When2Meet have an export function?

To address this issue, I got to to work and programmed a simple export program specifically tailored to When2Meet using BeautifulSoup.  With the When2Meet Data Export, you can effortlessly export the time slots, participant names, and their respective availabilities. No more tedious manual data input!

# Key Features
**Ease of use**: Simply input the When2Meet link and export the required information.

**Time-saving**: Skip the manual process of extracting data, enabling faster and more efficient scheduling.

**Accuracy**: Obtain precise availability details, ensuring reliable and informed decision-making.

# Known Issues
As this project was created to make my life easier in the planning process, it has served its purpose and I have not actively maintained or updated it recently. Consequently, there might be unconsidered edge cases and compatibility issues with different languages or scenarios that could affect the export functionality. Although it can provide a useful starting point for automating the extraction of When2Meet data, it may require further customization or adjustments to suit specific use cases.

# Closing Statement
Feel free to utilize the code and adapt it to your specific needs! The When2Meet Data Export project can serve as a starting point or a reference for similar endeavors in automating the extraction of data from When2Meet event polls. All the best!
